# eCLASRâ„¢: EMR Data Extraction

Site specific ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading) approaches are used to extract EMR data from local EMR
data warehouses; clean the raw data for inconsistency, mistakes, and extreme values; map the local EMR data elements
to the study-specific data elements according to the study's Common Data Model, and host the data of the candidate
patients in a local Screening Data Warehouse using the Common Data Warehousing Schema.

## Supported EHR Systems

We have experimental scripts for extracting data from the following EHR systems:

* **i2b2**
* **Clarity**
